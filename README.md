<< #Friction #HeadLoss #GUI #Python >>
<< This is a small code with a proper GUI which allows one to calculate the friction factor and the head loss of a pipeline: the flowing fluid can be either water either air, the section of the duct can be circular or rectangular. The estimation of the skin friction factor is done by using the Colebrook-White equation and the head loss along the pipeline is estimated by using the Darcyâ€“Weisbach equation. To run on Linux change the extension in *.py; To run on windows os just double click on the code icon, but be sure the extention of the file is .pyw>>
