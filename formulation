#### Formulation 

The code allows to estimate the friction factor on the internal wall of a duct by using the Colebrook-White equation. 
Once the input parameters are added the equation is solved iteratively.
Moreover the code estimate the head loss inside the tube by using the Darcy Weissbach Equation.
